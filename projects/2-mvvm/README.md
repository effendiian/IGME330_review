# IGME 330 - Project 2 #

You can read the full requirements for this project [here](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Fall-2019/blob/master/projects/project-2.md).

## Overview ##

Utilize an MVVM framework (Vue.js, React.js, Angular.js, etc.) to:

- Create an application that is easy to use, functional, and aesthetically pleasing.
- Run in all modern browsers.
- Demonstrate mastery of HTML5/CSS/JS in a web browser context.
- Meet all project requirements.

## Project Requirements ##

Utilize **TWO** distinctive web service APIs in the completed project:

- [Binary Jazz](https://binaryjazz.us/genrenator-api/) - Randomly generate a [genre](https://binaryjazz.us/wp-json/genrenator/v1/genre/) and [genre story](https://binaryjazz.us/wp-json/genrenator/v1/story/25/).
- [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) - Get information about pokemon.

This application allows users to search for pokemon. If the pokemon exists, it will return an 'entry' that describes the pokemon (with flavor-text).
