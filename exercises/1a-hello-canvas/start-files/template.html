			// C - all fill operations are now in yellow

			Make your version different:

			i) Change the yellow rectangle to a different solid color.

			ii) Change the text to your name, and change the color of the text to 
			something else. Note: Color can be specified in any legal CSS way, 
			i.e. pre-defined keyword, hex, shorthand hex, RGB value, RGB percentage, RGBA,
			 or even HSL
			http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors_legal.asp


			iii) Change the font of your name to something else. If you know how to embed
			 web fonts, find something here and use it: http://www.google.com/fonts

			iv) Add another line of text that reads “IGM”. Make sure that this text
			 appears in a different color and font than your name did.

			v) Add two squares to your canvas (50 x 50  or so) using 
			ctx.fillRect(x,y,width,height)- and make sure that the square color is the 
			same as the first text you 
			drew (your name).
