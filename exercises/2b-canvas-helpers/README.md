# HW - Canvas Procedural Artwork with "Helper" Functions

## I. Overview & Requirements

- In this assignment you will begin to build a library of canvas "helper" functions, and then test them by creating a simple procedural work of art. These functions will come in very handy once you begin to work on the Audio Visualizer project.
- In the starter code below, we have implemented `drawRectangle(ctx,x=0,y=0,width=25,height=25,fillStyle="red",strokeStyle="black",lineWidth=0)` for you, and added two tests of the function, one of which uses default arguments, the other uses all of the available parameters
- Requirements:
  - complete the implementation of these stubbed methods (see below): `drawCircle()`, `drawLine()`, `drawTriangle()` and `drawArc()`. The function signatures are all done for you, you just have to write the code that goes inside the functions
  - be sure to comment out or delete any "test code" that you used to verify that your functions work as intended
  - artwork requirements:
    - use each of the 5 functions at least once, and you must draw at least a dozen distinct shappes on the screen
    - use a `for` loop (or other iterative construct) at least once to create multiple shapes (see the "hair" in the first example below)
    - use all three canvas transformations (`ctx.translate()`, `ctx.rotate()`, `ctx.scale()`) at least one time. Don't forget to `ctx.save()` before you use the transformations, and `ctx.restore()` when you are done.
    - the art work must have a coherent theme, and not simply be a random jumble of shapes
    - the doesn't necessarily need to be "beautiful" - the crude first example below is sufficient, although we certainly hope you can do better. Example themes include: abstract geometric shapes arranged in a pleasing manner ([Mondrian](http://vart.institute/mondrian/) for example or something like this [Vector work](https://www.123rf.com/photo_85367242_stock-vector-vector-minimal-covers-procedural-design-futuristic-minimalistic-layout-conceptual-generative-backgro.html)) or just google "simple procedural art" for ideas. Other possible themes include a forest scene, a snowy field, an ocean, 2 or 3 houses, simple figures or animals, cars, etc
- Hints:
  - your recent lecture notes should come in very handy for the code portion of this assignment
  - outside of your helper functions, go ahead and set other global canvas attributes like `ctx.globalAlpha` and `ctx.shadowColor` etc to get the effects that you want. 
  - feel free to add additional parameters to these functions if you wish - for example, adding a `lineCap` parameter to `drawTriangle()`
  - feel free to create additional helper functions

## III. Example

1. Here's an example that meets requirements (you should definitely try to come up with something better):
- The head is made with `drawRectangle()`
- The eyes and pupils are made with `drawCircle()`
- The hair is made with `drawLine()` and a `for` loop, with a little `Math.random()` to slightly vary the length of the strands
- The nose is done with two `drawLine()` calls
- The mouth is done with `drawArc()`
- The teeth are done with `drawTriangle()` and here we used `ctx.translate()` / `ctx.rotate()` / `ctx.scale()` to make it MUCH easier to position the teeth

2. Here's another example that just uses `drawCircle()`, `for` loops, and `ctx.translate()` / `ctx.rotate()` / `ctx.scale()` - you would also need to find a way to use your other helper functions to meet requirements:
