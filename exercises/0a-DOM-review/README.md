# HW - DOM Review

## I. Overview

Easiest HW ever!

Our Week 1A demo had us building a simple web app. Extend it by doing the following:

Add a "last name" input so that we can greet the person using both their first and last name
Declaratively (using CSS) make the button 50 pixels tall by 100 pixels wide
Imperatively (using JavaScript) give the paragraph a red text color, and a yellow background color
ZIP and Post here!

Don't forget to ZIP the file - otherwise the JavaScript and CSS will be stripped out by mycourses.

## II. Submission

Submit files to MyCourses.
